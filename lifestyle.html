        <h3>Traffic Collisions in LA County</h3>
        <p>One upside of the decrease in mobility for non-essential activities is the decrease in traffic collisions across the nation. For instance, the monthly number of reported traffic collisions in Los Angeles County is typically around [calculate] collisions. After the Stay-At-Home Order that took into effect on March 19, 2020, the monthly number of reported traffic collisions decreased drastically to [calculate] collisions. With less accidents happening on the road, more resources can be allocated towards fighting COVID-19!</p>
        <p>Data source: [https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w]</p>
        <p>To-Dos:
            1) Add self-updating line chart on the side that compares # of traffic collisions vs. date (to clearly see decrease in traffic collisions)
            2) Add landmarks/image overlay to the county to provide more local context
            3) Improve the transitions between dates
            4) Fix Play button positioning (make it dynamic)</p>
