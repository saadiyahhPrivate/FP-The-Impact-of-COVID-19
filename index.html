    <h2> Abstract </h2>
    We are in the middle of a global pandemic which has severely impacted life across the globe.
    Each day, news about the progression of COVID-19 is reported and it has severely impacted various parts of our lives.
    Instead of focusing on the rates of infection or mortality rate, our team aims to look at other impacts and side effects the disease and measures used to constrain it have caused.
    While impacts of COVID-19 are numerous and vary considerably in nature, we have picked a handful of them to investigate, mostly based on the availability of reliable datasets.
    In this project, we explore the effects of COVID-19 on mobility, restaurant traffic, and schooling.
    Though most people would correctly expect each of these areas to decrease in activity due to COVID-19,
    our visualizations offer a detailed exploration of precisely how their activity has decreased.
    With this final project, we hope to encourage readers to reflect on the different ways COVID-19 has affected their daily lives
    and realize that we're all in this together.
