    This is a temporary landing page for our team project. Our narrative visualization will later be consolidated into a linear format so it can be read by scrolling on a single page instead of using tabs. <br><br>

    <h2> Project Summary </h2>
    We are in the middle of a global pandemic which has severely impacted life across the globe. On a daily basis, news about the progression of the COVID-19 is reported and it has severly impacted various parts of life in the US and elsewhere. Instead of focussing on the rates of infection or mortality rate, our team aims to look at other impacts and side effects the disease and measures used to constrain it have had on other aspects of daily. While impacts of COVID-19 are numerous and vary considerably in nature, we have picked a handful, mostly based on the availability (and reliability) of a dataset for the aspect we are investigating<br><br>

    To Navigate to the visualizations we have developped, use the tabs above. <br><br>
