    <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>For our project, we wanted to explore how COVID-
    19 has affected various aspects of life as we know it,
    by focusing on visualizing trends in mobility,
    schooling and social activities among other topics. To
    this end, we gathered data pertaining to these topics
    from multiple sources and wrangled it to produce
    visualizations focused on interactivity, while also
    exposing key insights we identified in the data
    exploration process.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to weave these contextually different
    visualizations into a single storyline that walks the
    viewer through the key insights we highlight in our
    custom visualizations.</p>
    <p>The tools used to wrangle the data were pandas,
    python and some Javascript. For visualizing the data,
    we used D3.js as well as D3plus.</p>

        <p>With this final project, we hope to encourage
    readers to reflect on the different ways COVID-19 has
    affected their daily lives and to remind them that
    we're all in this together!</p>
