      <h2> Flight Volume data </h2>

      <p> As more countries have restricted non-essential travel, some of which have even severely restricted international flights, the aviation industry has seen a very severe decline in traffic </p>
      <p> The flight volume graph below shows the number of daily commercial flights (Commercial passenger flights, cargo flights, charter flights, some business jet flights) and all flights (commercial flights + more business jet flights, private flights, gliders, most helicopter flights, most ambulance flights, government flights, some military flights, drones) in the world since more and more countries adopted more stringent travelling restricitions </p>
      <p> As from mid-March, we see a sharp decline in the number of daily flights across the world. </p>

        <h2>Traffic Collisions in LA County</h2>
        <p>One upside of the decrease in mobility for non-essential activities is the decrease in traffic collisions across the nation. For instance, the daily number of reported traffic collisions in Los Angeles County is typically around 140 collisions. After the Stay-At-Home Order that took into effect on March 19, 2020, the daily number of reported traffic collisions decreased drastically to around 60 collisions. With less accidents happening on the road, more resources can be allocated towards fighting COVID-19! </p>
        <p>data source: [https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w]</p>
        <p>to-dos: 1) Add self-updating line chart on the side that compares # of traffic collisions vs. date (to clearly see decrease in traffic collisions)
        2) Add landmarks/image overlay to the county to provide more local context
        3) Improve the transitions between dates
        4) Fix Play button positioning (make it dynamic)</p>
