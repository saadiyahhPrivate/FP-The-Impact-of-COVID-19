        <p> The explosive global spread of COVID-19 around mid-March has left almost every country scrambling to stop the virus in its tracks. As a result of the "social distancing" guidelines, foot traffic for public venues and events has effectively ceased. </p>

        <p>Mobility trends for the ten countries with the most number of cases (as of 04/28/2020) are shown below. Residential areas have seen a general increase in traffic, while activity for other categories that are more public in nature has dropped dramatically. </p>
        <p>* To be added: explanation of data source; choose top countries based on number of total cases or per capita; more local-level info about major events timeline (such as declaration of national emergency) </p>
