        <p> The explosive global spread of COVID-19 around mid-March has left almost every country scrambling to stop the virus in its tracks. As a result of the "social distancing" guidelines, foot traffic for public venues and events has effectively ceased. </p>

        <p>Mobility trends for the ten countries with the most number of cases (as of 04/28/2020) are shown below. Residential areas have seen a general increase in traffic, while activity for other categories that are more public in nature has dropped dramatically. </p>
        <p>* To be added: explanation of data source; choose top countries based on number of total cases or per capita; more local-level info about major events timeline (such as declaration of national emergency) </p>

      <p> As more countries have restricted non-essential travel, some of which have even severely restricted international flights, the aviation industry has seen a very severe decline in traffic </p>
      <p> The flight volume graph below shows the number of daily commercial flights (Commercial passenger flights, cargo flights, charter flights, some business jet flights) and all flights (commercial flights + more business jet flights, private flights, gliders, most helicopter flights, most ambulance flights, government flights, some military flights, drones) in the world since more and more countries adopted more stringent travelling restricitions </p>
      <p> As from mid-March, we see a sharp decline in the number of daily flights across the world. </p>
